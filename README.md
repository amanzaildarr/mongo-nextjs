# Next.js Full-Stack Application

This is a full-stack application built using Next.js, designed to connect with MongoDB. It includes APIs for interacting with MongoDB, leveraging Next.js Router v14 and Node.js v20.10 for efficient back-end management.

## Getting Started

To start the development server, use:

```bash
npm run dev
# This starts the development server on http://localhost:3000
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result. You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

For production, run:

```bash
npm run start
```
